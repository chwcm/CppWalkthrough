### What?
An ordered set of exercises for those who want to learn C++ and develop their algorithmic skills.

### Why?
As I teach some programming related subjects, I'm often asked to give practice exercises. I'm a lazy man, so I don't want to repeat this over and over again. 

### For whom?
The first exercises start with the very basics, and it will lead up gradually to more and more complex problems. The purpose of these is twofold: develop C++  and algorithmic skills. If you think you have a room for development in any of those two, maybe it is worth to look at them, even if you skip the first few.

### Will there be solutions provided?
No, the whole purpose of this is to suffer yourself through each problem. You learn much more from figuring out something yourself, than looking at the solution. 

### How can I check if my solution is good?
I plan to add basic I/O tests to each exercise later, and run them in a CI workflow automatically. Of course, a few test does not mean, that your code works well all the time, and also do not provide any feedback about your "style", whether it is good or tragic. For that you will need someone with experience to have a look at your code, and comment on it.

### Can I ask you to do that for me?
I'd suggest you to find a reliable person that you can meet irl, and invite for a few rounds of beer in exchange. 
Regarding me, I am not just lazy, but pretty busy at the same time. If I review your code, it takes away from my time for other projects, thus, it only works if you (hire)[https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01a0649a8d4ae27a60] me. 

### Are you even that good in C++?
No. I used to say, that the more I know about C++, and software development in general, the more I see how much I still have to learn. 

### I found a mistake / I have a suggestion
Great, those are always welcome, thank you!

### So how should I start?
Fork the repo, and start solving the problems. Each exercise has a `Description.md` file about the problem. 

### Will there be any updates?
Yes, I plan to keep adding exercises. I can't promise anything about the frequency, but I intend to keep the set growing. 

### Can I use the exercises in my class, tutorials, etc.
Feel free to do so. The more people use it, the better my time was spent.
