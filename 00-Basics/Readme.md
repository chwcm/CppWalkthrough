The exercises in this folder do not even require functions, only basic structures such as conditionals and loops.

Don't worry about input checks, just focus on the job, unless it is asked specifically.

Start working in a `main.cpp` file, that only has a `main()` function for now.

No need to use arrays yet either.

Always put a newline at the end of your output.
