Ask for integer numbers until a positive one is given.
Start with that number, and divide it by 2 if it is even, or multiply it by 3 and add 1 if it is odd.
Repeat this, and print all the numbers along the way, until 1 is reached.

Example input:
```
0
-2
3
```

Example output:
```
3
10
5
16
8
4
2
1
```
