Fill 2 arrays with 3 and 5 integers, respectively. 
You can expect, that there is no repeating one among the first 3 and the last 5 given integers.
Consider these arrays as sets, and print out "Subset" if the first one is the subset of the second one, and "Not a subset" otherwise.

Example input:
```
1 2 3
2 4 6 8 10
```

Example output:
```
Not a subset
```
