Ask for integer numbers until 0 is given.
You can expect the numbers to be non-negative.
Print out how many times each digit appeared (don't count the last 0).
Only print out digits that appeared at least once.

Example input:
```
123
34523
9761
34706

```

Example output:
```
0: 1
1: 2
2: 2
3: 4
4: 2
5: 1
6: 2
7: 2
9: 1
```
