The exercises in this folder do not require functions, only arrays  and basic structures such as conditionals and loops.

Don't worry about input checks, just focus on the job, unless it is asked specifically.

Start working in a `main.cpp` file, that only has a `main()` function for now.

Always put a newline at the end of your output.
