Fill a double array of size 7 from the input.
Then ask for a pivot number.
Copy the elements into another array is such a way, that the elements smaller than the pivot will appear at the beginning of the array, and the elements larger than the pivot will appear at the end.
The order of the elements in the two fractions should remain the same as in the original. 
Print out the second array.

Example input:
```
1.24234
-234.3345
234.456
-3.345
34.3453
54.234
653.234

10.345
```

Example output:
```
1.24234
-234.3345
-3.345
234.456
34.3453
54.234
653.234
```
